# Decentralized Music NFT Platform

## Project Overview

Our platform empowers artists and singers by transforming their music into unique digital assets.
Singers can upload their songs, and we divide each song into 1000 parts. Every part is represented as a token on the blockchain, giving artists full control over their creations and the ability to sell these tokens as NFTs.

### Key Features:

- **Song Upload**: Artists can easily upload their music to the platform.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Each song is divided into 1000 parts, with every part minted as an NFT on the blockchain.
- **Full Ownership**: Artists retain full ownership of their songs and can sell NFT parts to their fans or collectors.
- **NFT Marketplace**: A built-in marketplace where these NFTs can be sold or traded by fans.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Song**: Singers upload their songs to the platform.
2. **Mint Tokens**: The song is automatically divided into 1000 parts and each part is written as an NFT (ERC-721) on the Ethereum blockchain.
3. **Sell NFTs**: The artist receives these tokens and can list them for sale in our marketplace.
